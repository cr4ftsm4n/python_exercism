    "# Roman Numerals\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled\n",
    "it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and\n",
    "even bikinis. One thing they never discovered though was the number\n",
    "zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits\n",
    "slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with\n",
    "is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date\n",
    "their programmes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice\n",
    "these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack\n",
    "into stone tablets).\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    " 1  => I\n",
    "10  => X\n",
    " 7  => VII\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000.\n",
    "(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each\n",
    "digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any\n",
    "digit with a value of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:\n",
    "\n",
    "1000=M\n",
    "900=CM\n",
    "90=XC\n",
    "\n",
    "2008 is written as MMVIII:\n",
    "\n",
    "2000=MM\n",
    "8=VIII\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you shold write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
