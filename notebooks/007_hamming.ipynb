    "Calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or\n",
    "copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are\n",
    "vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect\n",
    "throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very\n",
    "rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact,\n",
    "the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated\n",
    "result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point\n",
    "mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.\n",
    "\n",
    "By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands\n",
    "taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of\n",
    "the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the\n",
    "evolutionary path between the two strands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the 'Hamming distance'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is found by comparing two DNA strands and counting how many of the\n",
    "nucleotides are different from their equivalent in the other string.\n",

    "The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length. This means\n",
    "that based on the definition, each language could deal with getting sequences\n",
    "of equal length differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test hamming_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest hamming_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest hamming_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/hamming` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
    "please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).\n",
