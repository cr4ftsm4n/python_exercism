    "# Robot Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a robot simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robots have three possible movements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- turn right\n",
    "- turn left\n",
    "- advance\n",
    "\n",
    "Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular\n",
    "direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,\n",
    "e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.\n",
    "\n",
    "The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the\n",
    "testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which\n",
    "direction it is pointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The letter-string \"RAALAL\" means:\n",
    "  - Turn right\n",
    "  - Advance twice\n",
    "  - Turn left\n",
    "  - Advance once\n",
    "  - Turn left yet again\n",
    "- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream\n",
    "  of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you shold write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
