    "# Score a single throw of dice in *Yacht*\n",
    "\n",
    "The dice game [Yacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht_(dice_game)) is from\n",
    "the same family as Poker Dice, Generala and particularly Yahtzee, of which it\n",
    "is a precursor. In the game, five dice are rolled and the result can be entered\n",
    "in any of twelve categories. The score of a throw of the dice depends on\n",
    "category chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scores in Yacht\n",
    "\n",
    "    Category    Score                   Example\n",
    "    Ones            1 × number of ones      1 1 1 4 5 scores 3\n",
    "    Twos            2 × number of twos      2 2 3 4 5 scores 4\n",
    "    Threes          3 × number of threes    3 3 3 3 3 scores 15\n",
    "    Fours           4 × number of fours     1 2 3 3 5 scores 0\n",
    "    Fives           5 × number of fives     5 1 5 2 5 scores 15\n",
    "    Sixes           6 × number of sixes     2 3 4 5 6 scores 6\n",
    "    Full House      Total of the dice       3 3 3 5 5 scores 19\n",
    "    Four of a Kind  Total of the four dice  4 4 4 4 6 scores 16\n",
    "    Little Straight 30 points               1 2 3 4 5 scores 30 \n",
    "    Big Straight    30 points               2 3 4 5 6 scores 30\n",
    "    Choice          Sum of the dice         2 3 3 4 6 scores 18\n",
    "    Yacht           50 points               4 4 4 4 4 scores 50\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dice do not satisfy the requirements of a category, the score is zero.\n",
    "If, for example, *Four Of A Kind* is entered in the *Yacht* category, zero\n",
    "points are scored. A *Yacht* scores zero if entered in the *Full House* category.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task \n",
    "Given a list of values for five dice and a category, your solution should return\n",
    "the score of the dice for that category. If the dice do not satisfy the requirements\n",
    "of the category your solution should return 0. You can assume that five values\n",
    "will always be presented, and the value of each will be between one and six\n",
    "inclusively. You should not assume that the dice are ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test yacht_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest yacht_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest yacht_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/yacht` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
    "please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).\n",
