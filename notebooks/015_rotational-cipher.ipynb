    "# Rotational Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on\n",
    "transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key\n",
    "between `0` and `26`. Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield\n",
    "the same output due to modular arithmetic. The letter is shifted\n",
    "for as many values as the value of the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.\n",
    "The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n",
    "Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`\n",
    "- ROT0  `c` gives `c`\n",
    "- ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`\n",
    "- ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`\n",
    "- ROT13 `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test rotational_cipher_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest rotational_cipher_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest rotational_cipher_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/rotational-cipher` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
    "please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).\n",
