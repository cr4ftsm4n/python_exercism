    "Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "An isogram (also known as a \"nonpattern word\") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of isograms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- lumberjacks\n",
    "- background\n",
    "- downstream\n",
    "- six-year-old\n",
    "\n",
    "The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",

    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test isogram_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest isogram_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest isogram_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",

    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/isogram` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
