    "\n",
    "For example, the sentence\n",

    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test crypto_square_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest crypto_square_test.py`\n",

    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",

    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",

    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
