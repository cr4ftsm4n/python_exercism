    "# SGF Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing a Smart Game Format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Game_Format) is a standard format for\n",
    "storing board game files, in particular go.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGF is a fairly simple format. An SGF file usually contains a single\n",
    "tree of nodes where each node is a property list. The property list\n",
    "contains key value pairs, each key can only occur once but may have\n",
    "multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An SGF file may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(;FF[4]C[root]SZ[19];B[aa];W[ab])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tree with three nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The top level node has two properties: FF\\[4\\] (key = \"FF\", value =\n",
    "  \"4\") and C\\[root\\](key = \"C\", value = \"root\"). (FF indicates the\n",
    "  version of SGF and C is a comment.)\n",
    "  - The top level node has a single child which has a single property:\n",
    "    B\\[aa\\].  (Black plays on the point encoded as \"aa\", which is the\n",
    "    1-1 point (which is a stupid place to play)).\n",
    "    - The B\\[aa\\] node has a single child which has a single property:\n",
    "      W\\[ab\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine an SGF file contains a lot of nodes with a single\n",
    "child, which is why there's a shorthand for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGF can encode variations of play. Go players do a lot of backtracking\n",
    "in their reviews (let's try this, doesn't work, let's try that) and SGF\n",
    "supports variations of play sequences. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(;FF[4](;B[aa];W[ab])(;B[dd];W[ee]))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the root node has two variations. The first (which by convention\n",
    "indicates what's actually played) is where black plays on 1-1. Black was\n",
    "sent this file by his teacher who pointed out a more sensible play in\n",
    "the second child of the root node: `B[dd]` (4-4 point, a very standard\n",
    "opening to take the corner).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key can have multiple values associated with it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(;FF[4];AB[aa][ab][ba])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `AB` (add black) is used to add three black stones to the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few more complexities to SGF (and parsing in general), which\n",
    "you can mostly ignore. You should assume that the input is encoded in\n",
    "UTF-8, the tests won't contain a charset property, so don't worry about\n",
    "that. Furthermore you may assume that all newlines are unix style (`\\n`,\n",
    "no `\\r` or `\\r\\n` will be in the tests) and that no optional whitespace\n",
    "between properties, nodes, etc will be in the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise will have you parse an SGF string and return a tree\n",
    "structure of properties. You do not need to encode knowledge about the\n",
    "data types of properties, just use the rules for the\n",
    "[text](http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/sgf4.html#text) type everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test sgf_parsing_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest sgf_parsing_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest sgf_parsing_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/sgf-parsing` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
    "please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Incomplete Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.\n"
