    "\n",
    "A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that 1 is not a prime number.\n",

    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the prime factors of 60?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our first divisor is 2. 2 goes into 60, leaving 30.\n",
    "- 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.\n",
    "  - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15. So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.\n",
    "- 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.\n",
    "  - 3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.\n",
    "  - 4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.\n",
    "- 5 does go cleanly into 5.\n",
    "- We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.\n",

    "Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime\n",
    "factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check this yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 * 2 * 3 * 5\n",
    "- = 4 * 15\n",
    "- = 60\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you shold write:\n",
