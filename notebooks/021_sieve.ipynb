    "Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all the primes from 2 up to a given\n",
    "number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all\n",
    "prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as\n",
    "composite (i.e. not prime) the multiples of each prime,\n",
    "starting with the multiples of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create your range, starting at two and continuing up to and including the given limit. (i.e. [2, limit])\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of repeating the following over and over:\n",
    "\n",
    "- take the next available unmarked number in your list (it is prime)\n",
    "- mark all the multiples of that number (they are not prime)\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat until you have processed each number in your range.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that have not\n",
    "been marked are prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wikipedia article has a useful graphic that explains the algorithm:\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is a very specific algorithm, and the tests don't check\n",
    "that you've implemented the algorithm, only that you've come up with the\n",
    "correct list of primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you shold write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/sieve` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
