    "\n",
    "Search a file for lines matching a regular expression pattern. Return the line\n",
    "number and contents of each matching line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unix [`grep`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html) command can be used to search for lines in one or more files\n",
    "that match a user-provided search query (known as the *pattern*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `grep` command takes three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The pattern used to match lines in a file.\n",
    "2. Zero or more flags to customize the matching behavior.\n",
    "3. One or more files in which to search for matching lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the `grep` function, which should read the contents\n",
    "of the specified files, find the lines that match the specified pattern\n",
    "and then output those lines as a single string. Note that the lines should\n",
    "be output in the order in which they were found, with the first matching line\n",
    "in the first file being output first.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose there is a file named \"input.txt\" with the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "hello\n",
    "world\n",
    "hello again\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to call `grep \"hello\" input.txt`, the returned string should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "hello\n",
    "hello again\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "As said earlier, the `grep` command should also support the following flags:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-n` Print the line numbers of each matching line.\n",
    "- `-l` Print only the names of files that contain at least one matching line.\n",
    "- `-i` Match line using a case-insensitive comparison.\n",
    "- `-v` Invert the program -- collect all lines that fail to match the pattern.\n",
    "- `-x` Only match entire lines, instead of lines that contain a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run `grep -n \"hello\" input.txt`, the `-n` flag will require the matching\n",
    "lines to be prefixed with its line number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "1:hello\n",
    "3:hello again\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we run `grep -i \"HELLO\" input.txt`, we'll do a case-insensitive match,\n",
    "and the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "hello\n",
    "hello again\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `grep` command should support multiple flags at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, running `grep -l -v \"hello\" file1.txt file2.txt` should\n",
    "print the names of files that do not contain the string \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you shold write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/grep` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
    "please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).\n",
