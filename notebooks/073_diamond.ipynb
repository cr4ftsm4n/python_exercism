    "# Diamond\n",
    "\n",
    "The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond\n",
    "shape. Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the\n",
    "supplied letter at the widest point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first row contains one 'A'.\n",
    "* The last row contains one 'A'.\n",
    "* All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.\n",
    "* All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).\n",
    "* The diamond is horizontally symmetric.\n",
    "* The diamond is vertically symmetric.\n",
    "* The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).\n",
    "* The letters form a diamond shape.\n",
    "* The top half has the letters in ascending order.\n",
    "* The bottom half has the letters in descending order.\n",
    "* The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
