    "Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),\n",
    "guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).\n",

    "The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",

    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test rna_transcription_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest rna_transcription_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",

    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
