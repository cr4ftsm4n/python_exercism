    "Given a number n, determine what the nth prime is.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test nth_prime_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest nth_prime_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest nth_prime_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",

    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
