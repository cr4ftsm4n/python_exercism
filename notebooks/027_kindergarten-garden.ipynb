    "# Kindergarten Garden\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is\n",
    "responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants. The teacher\n",
    "thought it would be a good idea to give them actual seeds, plant them in\n",
    "actual dirt, and grow actual plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "They've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills, and\n",
    "planted one type of plant in each cup, choosing randomly from the available\n",
    "types of seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "[window][window][window]\n",
    "........................ # each dot represents a cup\n",
    "........................\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 12 children in the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice, Bob, Charlie, David,\n",
    "- Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet,\n",
    "- Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each child gets 4 cups, two on each row. Their teacher assigns cups to\n",
    "the children alphabetically by their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram represents Alice's plants:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "[window][window][window]\n",
    "VR......................\n",
    "RG......................\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  In the\n",
    "second row she has a radish and some grass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with\n",
    "the row nearest the windows. From this, it should be able to determine\n",
    "which plants belong to each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:\n",

    "VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Violets, radishes, violets, radishes\n",
    "\n",
    "While asking for Bob's plants would yield:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clover, grass, clover, clover\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test kindergarten_garden_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest kindergarten_garden_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest kindergarten_garden_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/kindergarten-garden` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
