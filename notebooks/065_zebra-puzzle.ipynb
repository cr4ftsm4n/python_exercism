    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test zebra_puzzle_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest zebra_puzzle_test.py`\n",

    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",

    "## Submitting Exercises\n",

    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
