    "# Meetup\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the date of meetups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.  In this exercise, you\n",
    "will take a description of a meetup date, and return the actual meetup date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of general descriptions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first Monday of January 2017\n",
    "- The third Tuesday of January 2017\n",
    "- The wednesteenth of January 2017\n",
    "- The last Thursday of January 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptors you are expected to parse are:\n",
    "first, second, third, fourth, fifth, last, monteenth, tuesteenth, wednesteenth,\n",
    "thursteenth, friteenth, saturteenth, sunteenth\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \"monteenth\", \"tuesteenth\", etc are all made up words. There was a\n",
    "meetup whose members realized that there are exactly 7 numbered days in a month\n",
    "that end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week\n",
    "(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'\n",
    "in every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and\n",
    "descriptor calculate the date of the actual meetup.  For example, if given\n",
    "\"The first Monday of January 2017\", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test meetup_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.3+: `pytest meetup_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest meetup_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/meetup` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,\n",
    "please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).\n",
