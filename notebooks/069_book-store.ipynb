    "To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book\n",
    "series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One copy of any of the five books costs $8.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5%\n",
    "discount on those two books.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: that if you buy four books, of which 3 are\n",
    "different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that\n",
    "form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the\n",
    "price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only\n",
    "books of the same series), giving as big a discount as\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how much does this basket of books cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2 copies of the first book\n",
    "- 2 copies of the second book\n",
    "- 2 copies of the third book\n",
    "- 1 copy of the fourth book\n",
    "- 1 copy of the fifth book\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of grouping these 8 books is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 group of 5 --> 25% discount (1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th)\n",
    "- +1 group of 3 --> 10% discount (1st,2nd,3rd)\n",
    "\n",
    "This would give a total of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5 books at a 25% discount\n",
    "- +3 books at a 10% discount\n",
    "\n",
    "Resulting in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5 x (8 - 2.00) == 5 x 6.00 == $30.00\n",
    "- +3 x (8 - 0.80) == 3 x 7.20 == $21.60\n",
    "\n",
    "For a total of $51.60\n",

    "\n",
    "- 1 group of 4 books --> 20% discount  (1st,2nd,3rd,4th)\n",
    "- +1 group of 4 books --> 20% discount  (1st,2nd,3rd,5th)\n",
    "\n",
    "This would give a total of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 books at a 20% discount\n",
    "- +4 books at a 20% discount\n",
    "\n",
    "Resulting in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 x (8 - 1.60) == 4 x 6.40 == $25.60\n",
    "- +4 x (8 - 1.60) == 4 x 6.40 == $25.60\n",
    "\n",
    "For a total of $51.20\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you shold write:\n",
