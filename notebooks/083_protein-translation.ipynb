    "RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a polypeptide like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA: `\"AUGUUUUCU\"` => translates to\n",
    "\n",
    "Codons: `\"AUG\", \"UUU\", \"UCU\"`\n",
    "=> which become a polypeptide with the following sequence =>\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein: `\"Methionine\", \"Phenylalanine\", \"Serine\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids; however, all of the codon sequences and resulting amino acids are not important in this exercise.  If it works for one codon, the program should work for all of them.\n",
    "However, feel free to expand the list in the test suite to include them all.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also three terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "All subsequent codons after are ignored, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA: `\"AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG\"` =>\n",
    "\n",
    "Codons: `\"AUG\", \"UUU\", \"UCU\", \"UAA\", \"AUG\"` =>\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein: `\"Methionine\", \"Phenylalanine\", \"Serine\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the stop codon `\"UAA\"` terminates the translation and the final methionine is not translated into the protein sequence.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
